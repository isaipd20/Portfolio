                As a Mexican who moved to the USA, I have faced various challenges mainly due to the different language that
                I was used to, but that has not discouraged me from continuing my career in computer science.
                <br><br>
                I decided to study in SFSU because I knew I could grow my knowledge in software and technology. While studying,
                I learned about my passion to create things and experiences for people to enjoy. As a computer Scientist, this
                passion can become a reality and the possibilities are endless.
                <br><br>
                Outside work, my hobbies are playing video games and going to the gym. Also, I enjoy go and drink a coffee in my
                favorite place and walk my dog out.
